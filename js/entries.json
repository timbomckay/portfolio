(TMHU) was the first division of Toyota Motors to sell directly to consumers while still appeasing their franchise dealers. Our team at Blackstone Media handled the user experience, partnering with another company who managed the SAP Hybris integration. Our design team created the interface while I led the development team in bringing it to life.</p><p>The shop was launched with only two variations of one model but was structured for growth as more products are added. This required a lot of research for me to learn various types of user authorization to decide which fit our needs and how to securely store the info. Created flow charts to uncover what data is needed when, at what point to require authorization. Utilizing Vuex for state management to keep all necessary data in sync across components.</p>",

Blackstone Media had previously handled their redesign a couple years prior but a number of features had been added since and needed some restructuring. This would provide better maintenance, SEO management and content creation while also taking advantage of WordPress' newer REST API.</p><p>The refactoring didn't change the design but enabled us to refine some areas for consistency while modernizing the code to utilize flex layouts, rem sizing and Vue templating. The theme was created as a PHP & Vue hybrid for a potential conversion to a true Single-Page Application.</p><p>As the thought leader on the project, I provided direction on code structure for maintenance, naming conventions, and delegating tasks to coworkers appropriate to their skillset. When I wasn't answering questions or assisting other's I was typically staying up late configuring the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) page builder along with the necessary custom REST API endpoints. The new ACF implementation aided the client's content management by creating a hub of data, this removed a great deal of copy & pasting that they were previously required to handle providing more consistency throughout their site.</p>",
